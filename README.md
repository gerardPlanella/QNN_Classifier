# QNN Classifier
Development of a simple Classifier based on a Quantum Neural Network implemented with Pytorch and PennyLane. I first train an AutoEncoder to obtain a lower-dimensional latent representation of the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This encoded dataset is used to train our Quantum Classifier. This classifier is a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network, containing regular dense layers and trainable Variational Quantum Circuits.
